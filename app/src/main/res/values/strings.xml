It measures the number of times that the heart contracts or beats per minute . The speed of the heartbeat varies as a result of physical activity, threats to safety, and emotional responses. The resting heart rate refers to the heart rate when a person is at rest.</string>

Respiration rate is reported in respirations (breaths) per minute. Each respiration has two phases: Inhalation and exhalation. During inhalation, oxygen is brought into the lungs from where it is transported throughout the body via the bloodstream. During exhalation, carbon dioxide is eliminated</string>

Most of this pressure results from the heart pumping blood through the circulatory system. When used without qualification, the term \'blood pressure\' refers to the pressure in the large arteries. Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum pressure during one heartbeat) over diastolic pressure(minimum pressure between two heartbeats) in the cardiac cycle. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) above the surrounding atmospheric pressure.</string>

Contrary to the popular belief that the brain and body shut down during sleep, both go through several processes to ensure adequate recovery — from burning calories to clearing neurotoxins and more. Most healthy adults need 7-9 hours of sleep as per NIH, USA. Dozee’s sleep score quantifies the efficacy of your sleep by measuring several parameters related to your sleep including body vitals, sleep routine, composition of sleep, and restfulness among others.</string>
